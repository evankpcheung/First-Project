# First-Project

## Description

[First-Project] is my first Python-based project uploaded to GitHub. Originally written for Google Colab, it is designed to obtain a fitted equation for a parabolic surface. By adjusting the boundary conditions of the various fitting coefficients, this code can effectively fit a wide range of parabolic shapes.
